        approach_1_title: "1. Comprehensive Assessment",
        approach_1_desc: "We begin with a detailed consultation to understand the symptoms, medical history, and spiritual practices of the individual.

        approach_2_title: "2. Diagnostic Ruqyah",
        approach_2_desc: "If spiritual affliction is suspected, we perform diagnostic Ruqyah by reciting specific verses from the Qur'an and observing reactions.

        approach_3_desc: "Treatment involves regular Ruqyah sessions with specific Qur'anic verses, prophetic supplications (du'a), and prescribed self-care including listening to Ruqyah audio, performing daily adhkar, and maintaining ritual prayers. We also advise on Islamic lifestyle practices that strengthen spiritual protection.",
        approach_4_title: "4. Medical Collaboration",
        approach_4_desc: "We maintain open communication with the individual's healthcare providers when appropriate. If we suspect psychological or medical conditions, we strongly recommend professional medical evaluation. We never position spiritual treatment as a replacement for necessary medical care.",

        approach_5_desc: "Recovery is monitored through regular follow-ups. We educate individuals on preventive measures including daily adhkar, regular Qur'an recitation, maintaining prayers, and understanding Islamic spiritual protection.
